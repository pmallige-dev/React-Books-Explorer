# React-Books-Explorer
An app where one can access the greatest works of all times

<ul>
<li>This app is built using the <strong>create-react-app</strong> template.</li>
<li>For state management I have used <strong>Context API</strong>.</li>
<li>For styling I have leveraged the <a href="https://semantic-ui.com/">Sematic UI</a> Library.</li>
<li>The Books and data related to them are obtained from <a href="https://gutendex.com/">Gutendex API</a> a third party API which extracts the database of Books from <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>, a very popular website where one can view and download books that are copyright free.</li>
</ul>
